Definition: git status

**git status** is a very easy and useful command that lets you see the state of the working directory so you can know the changes that have been staged in your repository and which ones are untracked.

If you are using JupyterLab IDE, you can check this by clicking on the Git icon at the left side of your screen and then clicking on the 'Changes' button; you will see a list with Staged, Changed and Untracked files in there.
